# Particular notes of the study

## Univariate study

1. Most cases has positive values 
2. submetering in columns 7,8,9 has a skew distribution, with really long tails for every case, particular the submetering in 9 has a range between 16 and 20 with more cases, can be considered with a bimodal distribution.
3.  Global intensity (6) follow similar rule
4. Voltage for some reason has a lot outliers [-20,0) around 26k
5. Glabal active and reactive power have similar distribution, but second one have several outliers

## bivariate study

1. Correletion heatmap show some strong correlation between:
	a. Global activity and global intensity
	b. Global reactive power and global Voltage
	c. Global activity and sub metering 3
but is a) who shows the more linear behaviour trend expected.

## Reviewing ts series
1. Year 2006 is more noisy for first variable
2. searching for average the voltage show clear trends for months and in july show a clear down trend, probably is the hot season (summer)
